Description: 
--------------

AppNest is basically a platform that brings together a variety of mobile and desktop applications in one place. Users can easily search for their favorite apps, view detailed information (like app info, ratings with visible charts, and full descriptions), and install them directly.

Once a user installs an app, it’s saved in local storage — so they can view or manage their installed apps anytime. The installed apps can also be sorted based on download count in either ascending or descending order. And if the user no longer needs an app, they can simply uninstall it with one click.

In short, AppNest gives users a smart and interactive app store–like experience where they can search, install, sort, view details, and uninstall apps — all in one place.
